# PyBer_Analysis
## Purpose / Objective 
The purpose of this analysis is to use python and pandas libraries to create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type (suburban, urban, rural). The analysis will be visualized using multi-line graphs using the matplotlib that show the weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results -- describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types  
From the ride-sharing data summary, there are several notable fndings among the different city types. First, urban cities have the highest demand in rides while rural cities have the least demand. Moreover, average fare per driver for urban drivers is surprisingly lower than the average fare per driver in rural and suburban cities. Additionally, the summary also shows that there are a lot more drivers in the urban cities than the other city types.

## Summary -- provide 3 different business recommendations, addressing disparities among the city types 

I would like to provide my very unprofessional opinion and recommendations for the business. First, increase the pricing for the fares in the urban cities because there is obviously a demand for rides which will generate more revenue since the urban consumers are willingly to use ride-sharing platforms. Secondly, increase drivers in the rural areas by allocating a greater percentage of the fare to the drivers. This would increase the incentive for people to become a driver for ride-sharing platform. Third, I think incorporate a tipping system for the drivers in the rural and suburban cities because from the data it seems like these city type drivers are traveling a longer distance for their customers.
